# BIP the game

## BIP is a story-driven 3D puzzle platformer. A tiny android wakes up at the bottom of a dumpster and embarks on a journey to discover what life means to them. â€‹Solve tricky puzzles and escape dangerous hazards as the story unfolds.

Work on BIP started in 2015 and it has been developed over the last few years. It has been exhibited at several gaming festivals and has even won a spot showcasing at [The Gadget Show Live in 2016.](https://www.pcr-online.biz/2016/03/03/best-of-british-indie-gaming-to-be-showcased-at-gadget-show-live-2016/)
